# Premortem

### Introduction to Premortems

- Definition
- Purpose

Note:
A premortem is a strategic planning exercise where a team imagines a future failure and then works backward to identify potential causes. The purpose is to anticipate problems before they occur and to develop strategies to prevent them.

### Origins of the Premortem Exercise

- Concept by Gary Klein
- Introduced in 2007
- Article in Harvard Business Review

Note:
The concept of the premortem exercise was introduced by psychologist Gary Klein. It gained widespread recognition when he described it in a 2007 article published in the Harvard Business Review.

---

### Gary Klein's Background

- Expertise in decision making
- Research in naturalistic decision making
- Author of several books on cognitive psychology

Note:
Gary Klein is a renowned psychologist with expertise in decision making. His research in naturalistic decision making, which examines how people make decisions in real-world settings, laid the foundation for the premortem exercise. He has authored several books on cognitive psychology and decision making.

### The Premortem Article

- Title: "Performing a Project Premortem"
- Published: Harvard Business Review, September 2007
- Key ideas: Anticipate project failure, identify potential causes, develop mitigation strategies

Note:
The article titled "Performing a Project Premortem" was published in the September 2007 issue of the Harvard Business Review. In this article, Klein outlined the key ideas of the premortem exercise: anticipate project failure, identify potential causes, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.

---

### Inspiration and Development

- Inspired by postmortems
- Shift from reactive to proactive
- Aim: Improve project outcomes by foreseeing and addressing risks

Note:
Klein's inspiration for the premortem exercise came from postmortem analyses, which are conducted after a project fails to understand what went wrong. He proposed a shift from a reactive to a proactive approach, with the aim of improving project outcomes by foreseeing and addressing risks before they occur.

---

### Adoption and Impact

- Widely adopted in various industries
- Improved risk management
- Enhanced team collaboration and decision making

Note:
Since its introduction, the premortem exercise has been widely adopted across various industries. It has proven to be an effective tool for improving risk management, enhancing team collaboration, and fostering better decision making. Its proactive nature helps teams anticipate potential problems and take preventive measures.

---

### Summary

- Developed by Gary Klein in 2007
- Published in Harvard Business Review
- Proactive approach to risk management
- Widely adopted and impactful

Note:
In summary, the premortem exercise was developed by Gary Klein in 2007 and published in the Harvard Business Review. It offers a proactive approach to risk management by anticipating potential project failures and developing mitigation strategies. The exercise has been widely adopted and has made a significant impact on improving project outcomes.

### Benefits of Premortems

- Identify potential risks early
- Encourage proactive problem-solving
- Improve team collaboration

Note:
Premortems help identify potential risks early, encourage proactive problem-solving, and improve team collaboration. By anticipating issues, teams can develop strategies to mitigate risks and enhance project success.

### Steps in Conducting a Premortem

1. Assemble the team
2. Imagine a project failure
3. Identify reasons for failure
4. Prioritize risks
5. Develop mitigation strategies

Note:
Conducting a premortem involves five main steps. First, assemble the team. Next, imagine a scenario where the project has failed. Identify the reasons for this failure, prioritize the identified risks, and develop strategies to mitigate them.

---

### Step 1: Assemble the Team

- Include diverse perspectives
- Ensure key stakeholders are present

Note:
Assemble a team that includes members from different departments and roles to get diverse perspectives. Ensure that key stakeholders are present to provide insights and make decisions.

---

### Step 2: Imagine a Project Failure

- Describe the failure scenario
- Be as specific as possible

Note:
Ask the team to imagine that the project has failed. Describe the failure scenario in detail, being as specific as possible. This helps to visualize potential problems more clearly.

---

### Step 3: Identify Reasons for Failure

- Brainstorm potential causes
- Consider all aspects of the project

Note:
Brainstorm potential reasons for the project failure. Encourage the team to consider all aspects of the project, including technical, operational, and external factors. Document every possible cause, no matter how unlikely it may seem.

---

### Step 4: Prioritize Risks

- Assess impact and likelihood
- Focus on high-priority risks

Note:
Assess the impact and likelihood of each identified risk. Focus on high-priority risks that are both likely to occur and have significant impact. This helps to allocate resources effectively to the most critical areas.

---

### Step 5: Develop Mitigation Strategies

- Create action plans for each high-priority risk
- Assign responsibilities and deadlines

Note:
Develop mitigation strategies for each high-priority risk. Create detailed action plans, assign responsibilities to team members, and set deadlines for implementing these strategies. This ensures accountability and timely action.

---

### Example Premortem Scenario

- Failure: IoT system crashes frequently
- Potential causes:
  - Software bugs
  - Hardware incompatibility
  - Insufficient testing
  - Security breaches
- Mitigation strategies:
  - Conduct thorough testing
  - Ensure hardware compatibility
  - Implement robust security measures

Note:
For example, if the imagined failure is that the IoT system crashes frequently, potential causes might include software bugs, hardware incompatibility, insufficient testing, and security breaches. Mitigation strategies could involve conducting thorough testing, ensuring hardware compatibility, and implementing robust security measures.

---

### Group Exercise: Conduct a Premortem

- Break into groups
- Choose a project and imagine its failure
- Identify potential causes and mitigation strategies
- Share findings

Note:
Now, let's conduct a premortem exercise. Break into groups and choose a project. Imagine that the project has failed and identify potential causes. Develop mitigation strategies for the high-priority risks. After the exercise, we'll share our findings and discuss.

---

### Group Discussion: Premortem Findings

- Share identified risks
- Discuss mitigation strategies

Note:
Let's come back together and share the risks your groups identified during the premortem exercise. Discuss the mitigation strategies you developed and consider any additional insights brought up by your peers. This discussion will help reinforce your understanding of premortems and how they can be applied effectively.
