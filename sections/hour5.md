### Introduction to Test Methods

- Definition of test methods
- Importance in the software development lifecycle

---

### Overview of Test Methods

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

Note:
We’ll cover four primary test methods: unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Each method serves a specific purpose in the testing process.

---

### Unit Testing

- Testing individual components
- Ensures functionality of specific parts
- Typically done by developers

Note:
Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of the software to ensure they work correctly. This type of testing is usually done by developers during the development phase.

---

### Example of Unit Testing

```python
import unittest

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note:
Here’s a simple example of a unit test using Python’s unittest framework. It tests the addition operation to ensure it returns the correct result.

---

### Integration Testing

- Testing combined parts of an application
- Ensures components work together
- Identifies interface issues

Note:
Integration testing involves combining individual components and testing them as a group. The goal is to ensure that the integrated components work together as expected and to identify any interface issues between them.

---

### System Testing

- Testing the entire system as a whole
- Ensures the system meets requirements
- Conducted by QA teams

Note:
System testing involves testing the complete system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements. This type of testing is typically conducted by QA teams and focuses on validating the end-to-end functionality of the application.

---

### Example of System Testing

```python
import unittest

class TestSystem(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_system(self):
        user = create_user('testuser')
        self.assertIsNotNone(user)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note:
In this system test example, we test the user creation functionality of the entire system. The test ensures that the create_user function works correctly within the system.

---

### Acceptance Testing

- Validating software against business requirements
- Ensures the system meets user needs
- Often involves end users

Note:
Acceptance testing validates the software against business requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This type of testing often involves end users and is the final step before the software is released.

### Comparing Test Methods

| Method              | Purpose                                | Who Performs  | When Performed            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Unit Testing        | Test individual components             | Developers    | During development        |
| Integration Testing | Test combined parts                    | Developers/QA | After unit testing        |
| System Testing      | Test the entire system                 | QA teams      | After integration testing |
| Acceptance Testing  | Validate against business requirements | End users/QA  | Before release            |

Note:
Here’s a comparison of the different test methods, highlighting their purpose, who performs them, and when they are performed in the development lifecycle.

### Hands-On Practice: Testing Methods

- Break into groups
- Choose a test method to practice
- Write and run test cases

Note:
Now, let’s break into groups. Choose one of the test methods we discussed and write test cases for a sample project. This hands-on practice will help you apply what we’ve learned today.

---

### Group Activity: Testing Methods

- Write test cases for different scenarios
- Refactor code if necessary
- Share findings with the class

Note:
During this activity, write test cases for various scenarios using the chosen test method. Refactor your code if necessary, and share your findings and experiences with the class.

---

### Review and Discussion

- Present your test cases
- Discuss challenges and solutions
- Provide feedback and suggestions

Note:
Each group will now present their test cases. We’ll discuss any challenges you faced, solutions you found, and provide feedback and suggestions to enhance your understanding of the different test methods.

---

### Summary and Q&A

- Recap of test methods
- Benefits and best practices
- Open floor for questions

Note:
To wrap up, we’ve covered various test methods, their benefits, and best practices. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any points, feel free to ask.
